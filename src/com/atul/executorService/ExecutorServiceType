	Cached Thread Pool : -> 
		unlike Fixed thread pool, it doesn't have blocking queue for tasks, instead it has Synchronous queue. 
		which can hold only 1 task, if checks if any thread is free then it is assign task to that thread, if all threads are busy then it will create a new one 
		and assign task. 
		in this way it can create any number of threads. 
		as soon as existing threads are done with task, it will use them for new tasks. 
		at the same time as it finds the thread sitting idel for more than 60 sec, it will kill the thread. 
		
		it is good option when we have long list of very small tasks.
